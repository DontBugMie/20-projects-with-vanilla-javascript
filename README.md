This is a fun, practical & project based course for all skill levels. The projects in this course are designed to get you building things using HTML5, CSS & JavaScript with no frameworks or libraries. Every project is built from scratch and has some kind of dynamic functionality from small games to an expense tracker to a breathing relax app.
Although this is a project based course, I will still be explaining everything as I go. These are mini-projects designed for you to complete in a few hours.
You should have some basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS. If you are brand new, I would suggest my Modern HTML/CSS From The Beginning and/or my Modern JS From The Beginning courses on Udemy. This course is a mix of both.

Some Things You Will Learn In These Projects:

```
 *	Create Layouts & UI's With HTML/CSS ( No CSS Frameworks )
